01. Generate Excel file with 100 000 rows with random generated data.
02.Factorial Calculator that calculates 1 000 000 times random factorials form 1 to 10.
03.Factorial Calculator that calculates 1 000 000 times random factorials form 1 to 10. - OPTIMIZED

First console application - Generate Excel file

The program generate Excel file with 100 000 rows of random generated data.
	Build with:
		.NET C#
	Used libraries to create and manage excel spreadsheeds: 
		EPPlus

	1. Program creates ExcelPackage stream.
	2. Add ExcelWorkSheet to package.
	3. Customize first header row.
		3.1. Set bold font style.
		3.2. Set pattern type to be solid.
		3.3. Set background color.
	4. Generates rows with random data and add them to worksheet.
		4.1. Get random name from array.
		4.2. Get random age.
		4.3. Get random score.
		4.4. Add row in worksheet.
	5. Set font color to odd rows which has values.
	6. Add formula to cell. formula calculates average form given cell to given cell.
	7. Save the file.

Second console application - Calculate 1 000 000 times factorial - unoptimized
	Biuld with:
		.NET C#
	
	1. Initialize stopwatch.
		1.1. Start stopwatch.
	2. Initialize factorial variable.
		2.1. Set factorial value to 1.
	3. Initialize random class.
	4. Start a loop that has 1 000 000 rounds.
		4.1. Get random number from 1 to 10.
		4.2. Create loop that has "num" value rounds. Starts from 1.
			4.2.1. On each round multily current factorial value with number of current round of a loop.
 			And repeat this to the end of a internal loop. Then we have the factorial(num).
		4.3. Set factorial value to 1. And repeat to the end of a external loop.
		 We set factorial to 1 because we will calculate new factorial.
	5. Stop stopwatch.
	6. Print execution time.

Third console application - Calculate 1 000 000 times factorial - optimized
	Build with:
		.NET C#
	Using dinamic optimization.
	
	1. Initialize static integer array for saving the calculated factorials.
	2. Start stopwatch.
	3. Initialize starting factorial value, random class, and num.
	4. Start a loop with 1 000 000 rounds.
		4.1. Get random number from 1 to 10.
		4.2. Call function that calculates factorial.
			4.2.1. If number is 1 return 1.
			4.2.2. If we have already calculated factorial of num in array - return it.
			4.2.3. If we haven`t we calculate it and save the value in the array. 
			4.2.4. Return the value of factorial of num.
	5. Stop stopwatch.
	6. Print execution time.
